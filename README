This program implements a derivative of BK-Tree data structure described in
"Some Approaches to Best-Match File Searching" paper of W. A. Burkhard and
R. M. Keller. For more information about the paper, see

In the implementation, I have used below structure to store values in the nodes:

struct node {
  distance: Metric distance between current node and its parent.
  value   : Value stored in current node.
  nodes   : Nodes collected under this node.
}

During every search phase, instead of walking through nodes via

  j = {j, j+1, j-1, j+2, j-2, ...}
    = {0, (-1)^i+1 * ceil(i/2)}, i = 1, 2, 3, ...

as described in the original paper, program sorts nodes according their relative
distance to value being searched:

  distance = d(searched-value, current-node-value)
  sort(nodes, lambda(node) { abs(distance - distance-of(node)) }

There is no restriction on the type of the value which will be stored in the
tree, as long as you supply appropriate metric function.

Here is an example about how to used supplied interface.

(defpackage :bk-tree-test (:use :cl :bk-tree))
(in-package :bk-tree-test)

(defvar *words* nil)
(defvar *tree* nil)

;; Build *WORDS* list and *TREE*.
(with-open-file (in "/home/vy/lisp/english-words.txt")
  (loop for line = (read-line in nil nil)
        while line
        do (push
            (string-trim '(#\space #\tab #\cr #\lf) line)
            *words*)))

;; Check *WORDS*.
(if (endp *words*)
    (error "*WORDS* is empty!"))

;; Initialize & fill the *TREE*.
(setq *tree* (make-instance 'bk-tree :value (first *words*)))
(loop for word in (rest *words*)
      do (handler-case (insert-value word *tree*)
           (duplicate-value (ctx)
             (format t "Duplicated: ~a~%" word))))

;; Let's see that green tree.
(print-tree *tree*)

;; Test BK-Tree.
(time
 (mapc
  (lambda (result)
    (format t "~a ~a~%" (distance-of result) (value-of result)))
  (collect-search-results "kernel" *tree* :threshold 2)))

;; Test brute levenshtein.
(time
 (loop with target-word = "kernel"
       with results = (sort
                       (mapcar
                        (lambda (word)
                          (cons (levenshtein target-word word) word))
                        *words*)
                       #'<
                       :key #'car)
       repeat 50      
       for (distance . value) in results
       while (<= distance 2)
       do (format t "~a ~a~%" distance value)))
